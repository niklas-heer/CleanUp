## Description ##

This is a little Workflow for the Mac Automator to clean 2 folders in a custom repo I use. It will delete all files in these 2 folders, except for the "empty"-file (default). I made it a service so you just have to right-click on the folder and execute the service. The main function of this service is provided by the ClenUp.py-Script. Enjoy ;D
